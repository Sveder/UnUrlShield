There was once a site called urlshield whose premise was to protect a link with a captcha.
That wasn't such a bad idea, except that their site was broken, the user experience was horrible and most
importantly - their captcha sucked. To help automate a site that used it I wrote something that
makes it easy for OCR software to have 100% success, by separating the letters.
